# Code
This is a simple website that aims to dynamicly add content to my webpage.

NOTE: This is the first time i work with any kind of webdev, so, God show mersy.

More info will be added along the way.

My first thoughts is to have each 'post' to add to the page as folders, and those contain:
  * A picture (preveiw).
  * A .txt file with title and introduction.
  * The actual content (html to add to a page or a link).

So the structure would be:
```
Index.php

20170125/
-- Picture.png
-- Introduction.txt
-- Test with a div.html

20170126/
-- Picture.png
-- Introduction.txt
-- Test with a p tag.html
```

As of now development is shown on: https://www.jesperpost.dk/test/index.php
